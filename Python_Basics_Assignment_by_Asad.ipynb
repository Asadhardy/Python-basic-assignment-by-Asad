    "#The key features of python which makes it the most popular chocie among programmers, are as following\n",
    "\n",
    "#1.Python programming language is easy to read and write, it has readability in syntax which is easy to understand\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "number = 10  \n",
    "print(number)\n",
    "#Insights: 10 is stored in the variable number, and it is an integer\n",
    "          #printing the number variable in which 10 is stored, Output will be 10 in the console\n",
    "             \n",
    "#2.Python is an interpreted language, which means python code executes line by line (in order), how the code is written or structured\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\") \n",
    "print(\"Hello Asad\") \n",
    "#Insights: as soon as we run the file/code, the interpreter executes the code\n",
    "          # after printing Hello World it will pring Hello Asad, because Hello World was writeen first in order to execute\n",
    "    \n",
    "#3.Python is dynamically typed programming language, if you declared a variable, you dont have to specify the variable type, \n",
    "   #python will detect the type as soon as the value is created the value in the variable and specify the type.\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "a = \"Hello Asad\"\n",
    "#Insights: first we declare 5 in the variable and then a string(\"Hello Asad\") is the same variable, python automaticatlly detect the data type\n",

    "    \n",
    "#4.Python has a extensive amount of library, in has more than 137,000 libraries, you just have to import the library to use that library.\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "import random\n",

    "              \n",
    "#5.Python is platform independent which means python can run on any operating system\n",
    "#Example:\n",
    "        # python can run on Window(os)\n",
